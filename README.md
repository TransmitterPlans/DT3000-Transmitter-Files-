# DT6000-Transmitter-Files-
These are the files for creating a DT6000 transmitter except microchip controller program and Gerber files for the board.
Sorry, those files are confidential, but can be reverse engineered from the plans if you have plenty of time.
There are plenty of examples of writing the code, the debouncing part via software is probably the hardest.
None the less, with determination it can be be done.  If I did it, you can too.
The hardware has been all worked out for you, take the time to learn the Arduino programming.
Many things to make with the microcontroller chip technology once it is understood.
If your really stuck, just wait awhile, some one will probably post the code some place.
Or, maybe I can give you a hint if you send me what you have done. 
GOOD LUCK
