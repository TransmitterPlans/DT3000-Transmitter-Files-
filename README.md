# DT6000-Transmitter-Files-
These are the files for creating a DT6000 transmitter except microchip controller program and Gerber files for the board.

When purchasing the board and chip from Ebay or Etsy, the chip is preprogrammed and does not require any programming.

Sorry, those files are confidential, but can be reverse engineered from the plans if you have plenty of time.
None the less if you would like to try programming a chip yourself, there are plenty of examples of writing the code, the debouncing part via software is probably the hardest.

With determination it can be be done.  If I did it, you can too.
The hardware has been all worked out for you, take the time to learn the Arduino programming.
Many things to make with the microcontroller chip technology once it is understood.

The SSTRAN AMT3000 and AMT5000 manuals are lsited as well but are not needed to build the DT6000.  You only need the DT6000 Plans file along with the Mouser parts file and stl file for face and knobs.  In other words, just ignore the AMT5000 and 3000 files if you have no interest.  The LPAM book is included if you are interested.  If you have questions...   TransmitterPlans@gmail.com
