# DT3000-Transmitter-Files-
Files for creating a DT3000 transmitter except microchip controller program.
There are plenty of examples of writing the code, the debouncing part via software is probably the hardest.
None the less, with determination it can be be done.
The hardware has been all worked out for you, take the time to learn the Arduino programming.
If your really stuck, just wait awhile, some one will probably post the code some place.
Or, maybe I can give you a hint if you send me what you have done.  TransmitterPlans@gmail.com
GOOD LUCK
